## Project Description
**The Infinite Sip Café** is a surreal, interactive web experience disguised as a cozy coffee shop.The menu refreshes every few seconds, revealing strange drinks and dishes with unpredictable “side effects.” Customer reviews glitch between glowing praise and cryptic warnings, while an in-site chatbot “manager” responds with unsettling, random messages. Combining glitch animations, CRT-inspired styling, and hidden surprises, the site blends comforting café aesthetics with eerie, reality-bending interactions.
